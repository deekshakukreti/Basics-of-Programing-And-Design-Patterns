Understanding Object-Oriented Programming

# Evolution of OOP
During the 1980's, procedural-oriented programming languages such as C, Pascal and Fortran were widely used to develop business-oriented software systems. Procedural languages organise from top to bottom i.e. the program is a series of steps that run one after another. These type of programs were easy to manage with few hundred lines of code, but it was difficult to manage when they become large. In order to overcome this challenge, structured programming was introduced which would break down the code into functions or procedures. Although it was an improvement, the program failed to perform complex business logics as it was difficult to maintain the code. Existing functionality was not easy to alter without impacting other dependent functionality which affected other systems.

Next came the object-oriented programming methods and programming language. The benefits included :

1. The ability to maintain and implement changes in the programs more efficiently and rapidly.
2. The ability to reuse code componenets in other programs.
3. The ability to create a more intuitive graphical-user interface for users.
