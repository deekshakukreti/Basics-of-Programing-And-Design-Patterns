# Open - Closed Principle

Bertrand Mayer in 1988 paraphrased that software entities should be open for extension,
 but closed for modification.

What is that Open - Closed Principle brings to us ? When a single change in program results
in cascade of changes to dependent modules, the program becomes fragile, rigid, unpredictable and
unreasonable. The open - closed principle emphasise that modules should not change. If their is 
a change in requirement then it should be extended by adding new code, and not by changing old code that already
works. Modules in Open - Closed principle are open for extension and closed for modification.

Module that cannot be changed is considered to have a fixed behaviour, however the module that is changed
is extended with new funcionality. The question is how can these two opposing attributes be implemented?
