# SOLID Principles

While programming, we face bad design issues. Those issues can be :

1. Rigidity : It is hard to change because every change affects too many other parts of the system.
2. Fragility : When you make a change, unexpected parts of the system breaks.
3. Immobility : It is hard to reuse in another application because it cannot be disentangled from the   current application.

These three traits can be used to understand if the design is a 'Good Design' or a 'Bad Design'.

SOLID Principles not only affect the class design, but other architectures as well. The five principles initial and it's correspondence is:

1. Single Responsibility principle
2. Open / Closed principle
3. Liskov substitution principle
4. Interface segregation principle
5. Dependency Inversion principle

In the above folder structure, I have described each SOLID principles with detaied description and implementation.
